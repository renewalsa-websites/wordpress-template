# Working with platform.sh

Renewal SA websites are hosted on Platform.sh, a modern hosting platform that combines  dev-ops with high-end application hosting. Platform.sh is built to work in tandem with git, and has numerous features to help work across multiple environments for each site.

Using Platform.sh imposes some limitations or requirements on our apps - but these align with best practices and the [12 Factor App](https://12factor.net) guidelines for building solid modern applications.

To best understand Platform.sh it's recommended that you  read their own documentation
